                                                It is a necessary part of our business to collect certain types of Special Categories
                                                of Personal Data about you. For example, we need to collect data about your state
                                                of health if you inform us about that you are pregnant, have a medical condition
                                                which requires special equipment, or when you make a request for mobility assistance.
                                                Making certain meal choices will also involve the collection of data about your
                                                religious beliefs or state of health, for example if you inform us that you require

                                                a flight booking is made in respect of a minor passenger. This is necessary for
